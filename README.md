# blog-app

The dependencies in this app:

1. Express :: Backend framework(Node Framework)
2. Express-Validator :: Used for data validation.(Eg, If any field does not have any value,it will raise an alert)
3. bcryptjs :: Password encryption
4. config :: Global variable
5. gravatar :: Profile avatar
6. jsonwebtoken(JWT) :: JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
7. mongoose :: acts like a middle-man between database and website
8. request :: helps us make HTTP request to other APIs
9. nodemon :: watches over the server
10. concurrently :: allows us to run both backend and frontend at the same time
